1. Purpose:
   The script execution engine is responsible for running the analysis code provided by data recipients on the sensitive data, without restricting their choice of programming languages or tools.

2. Key Functions:
   a. Code and Dependency Management: It receives and archives the complete code submission from the data recipient, including all dependencies.
   b. Environment Setup: It prepares an execution environment based on the recipient's specifications.
   c. Data Integration: It securely provides access to the sensitive data within the execution environment.
   d. Execution: It runs the recipient's code in a controlled manner.
   e. Output Capture: It collects and processes the results of the analysis.

3. Flexibility:
   a. Language Agnostic: It supports any programming language or analysis tool the data recipient chooses to use.
   b. Custom Environments: It allows recipients to specify their required runtime environment.

4. Containerization:
   Likely uses containerization technology (e.g., Docker) to create isolated, reproducible environments for each analysis job.

5. Archiving:
   a. Code Preservation: It stores the complete code submission, including all dependencies.
   b. Environment Documentation: It records the exact specifications of the execution environment.
   c. Excludes Sensitive Data: The archive explicitly does not include the sensitive data itself.

6. Security Measures:
   a. Resource Limits: Enforces CPU time, memory usage, and other resource constraints.
   b. Network Isolation: Restricts network access to prevent data exfiltration.
   c. Input/Output Control: Manages how data enters and leaves the execution environment.

7. Execution Flow:
   a. Receives code and environment specifications from the data recipient.
   b. Builds the specified environment (e.g., creates a Docker container).
   c. Mounts or provides access to the sensitive data in a controlled manner.
   d. Executes the recipient's code within this environment.
   e. Captures and processes the output.
   f. Archives the code, dependencies, and environment specifications.

8. Result Processing:
   Includes checks on the output to ensure no raw sensitive data is included in the results.

9. Audit Trail:
   Maintains logs of each execution, including start time, duration, resource usage, and completion status.

This approach provides maximum flexibility to data recipients while still maintaining control over the sensitive data. The engine focuses on creating a secure, isolated environment for execution and managing the archiving process, rather than on the specifics of how the analysis is performed. This aligns with your goal of allowing data recipients to use their preferred tools and methods while ensuring the security and reproducibility of the analysis process.
